  ```json
  {
    "key": "groq_api_key",
    "value": "gsk_...",
    "description": "Groq API Key for AI services",
    "updated_at": "2025-10-09T...",
    "updated_by": "user_id"
  }
  ```

### 2. 🧠 AI Conversational Memory System

**Backend Implementation:**
- ✅ Token-efficient memory management
- ✅ New collections:
  - `conversations` - Stores recent messages per session
  - `memories` - Stores long-term user summaries
- ✅ Automatic compression after 10 messages (keeps last 5 + summary)
- ✅ New endpoints:
  - `POST /api/ai/chat/with-memory` - Chat with memory context
  - `DELETE /api/ai/chat/memory/{session_id}` - Clear conversation memory
- ✅ Memory context building:
  - Long-term user summary
  - Conversation summary from older messages
  - Recent 5 messages for immediate context
- ✅ Smart summarization using AI to compress old conversations

**Frontend Implementation:**
- ✅ Updated `AICoachPanel` to use memory-enabled chat
- ✅ Session ID management (unique per conversation)
- ✅ Memory indicator badge ("🧠 Memory Active")
- ✅ Clear memory button
- ✅ Visual feedback when memory is active

**Memory System Flow:**
1. User sends message → System loads memory context
2. Builds messages: [long-term summary] + [conversation summary] + [recent 5 msgs] + [new message]
3. AI responds with full context
4. Saves conversation turn to database
5. After 10 messages, auto-compresses oldest 5 into summary

  - User role and name

**Frontend Implementation:**
- ✅ Beautiful `AIAssistButton` reusable component
- ✅ Gradient purple-pink styling
- ✅ Smart mode detection (Fill empty / Improve existing)

---

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

1. **API Key Caching**: 60-second cache reduces DB queries
2. **Memory Compression**: Only keeps last 5 messages + summaries
3. **Async Operations**: All AI calls are non-blocking
4. **Smart Context**: Only sends relevant context to AI (reduces tokens)

---

## 🎯 Token Efficiency

**Memory System:**
- Without memory: Each request is isolated (~500 tokens)
- With memory naive approach: All messages sent (~5000+ tokens after 20 messages)
- With smart compression: Summary + last 5 messages (~800-1200 tokens max)
- **Savings: 75-85% token reduction while maintaining context!**

- Multi-language support for AI Assist
- More granular settings (model selection, temperature, etc.)
- Memory analytics dashboard
- Export conversation history
