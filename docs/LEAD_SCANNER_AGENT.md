- 10,000-49,999 followers: +30 points
- 5,000-9,999 followers: +20 points
- <5,000 followers: +10 points

Engagement Rate:
- 5.0%+ engagement: +40 points
- 3.0-4.9% engagement: +30 points
- 2.0-2.9% engagement: +20 points
- <2.0% engagement: +10 points

Contact Information:
- Has email: +20 points

Maximum Total: 100 points
```

Quality Thresholds:
- **High Quality**: 70+ (Green)
- **Medium Quality**: 50-69 (Yellow)
- **Low Quality**: <50 (Gray)

## Troubleshooting

### Scan Returns No Results
- Check if keywords are too specific
- Verify platform availability
- Lower minimum follower threshold
- Check for network/API issues

### Duplicate Leads
- System automatically detects duplicates by username+platform
- Duplicates are counted but not saved
- Check scan history for duplicate counts

### Quality Scores Too Low
- Adjust quality scoring algorithm in `lead_scanner_service.py`
- Consider lowering minimum follower thresholds
- Review engagement rate calculations

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Review logs in `/var/log/backend.log`
- Check MongoDB collections for data integrity
- Verify JWT token validity
- Ensure admin role permissions are set correctly
