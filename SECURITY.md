## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Level Up Agency seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Please Do Not:

- Open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
- Discuss the vulnerability in public forums, chat rooms, or mailing lists

### Please Do:

1. **Email us directly** at: security@levelupagency.com (or contact the repository owner)
2. **Include the following information**:
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
   - Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the vulnerability

### What to Expect:

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Communication**: We will keep you informed about our progress
- **Timeline**: We aim to patch critical vulnerabilities within 7 days
- **Credit**: We will give you credit for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors:

1. **Never commit sensitive data**:
   - API keys, tokens, or credentials
   - Private keys or certificates
   - Database passwords
   - User data

2. **Use environment variables** for all configuration:
   - Always use `.env` files for local development
   - Never commit `.env` files to the repository
   - Use `.env.example` as a template

3. **Dependencies**:
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Review security advisories regularly
   - Use `npm audit` and `pip-audit` to check for vulnerabilities

4. **Code Review**:
   - All code must be reviewed before merging
   - Security-sensitive changes require extra scrutiny
   - Follow secure coding guidelines

### For Deployments:

1. **Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # Always use strong, unique secrets in production
   JWT_SECRET=<strong-random-secret-32+characters>
   
   # Use HTTPS in production
   CORS_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com
   ```

2. **Database**:
   - Enable MongoDB authentication
   - Use strong passwords
   - Restrict network access
   - Enable encryption at rest and in transit

3. **SSL/TLS**:
   - Always use HTTPS in production
   - Use valid SSL certificates
   - Configure proper security headers

4. **Access Control**:
   - Use role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Implement principle of least privilege
   - Regularly review user permissions

5. **Monitoring**:
   - Enable logging for security events
   - Monitor for suspicious activity
   - Set up alerts for critical issues

## Known Security Considerations

### Authentication
- JWT tokens are used for authentication
- Tokens expire after a configured time period
- Use strong JWT secrets in production

### CORS
- Configure CORS origins appropriately
- Never use `allow_origins=["*"]` in production
- Whitelist only trusted domains

### File Uploads
- Validate file types and sizes
- Scan uploaded files for malware
- Store uploads outside the web root

### API Rate Limiting
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- Protect against brute force attacks
- Monitor for unusual traffic patterns

## Security Headers

The application includes the following security headers:

```nginx
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade
```

## Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services:
- **ElevenLabs**: Voice synthesis (API keys required)
- **MongoDB**: Database (ensure proper authentication)
- **GitHub Container Registry**: Docker image storage

## Compliance

- Follow OWASP Top 10 guidelines
- Comply with data protection regulations
- Implement proper data retention policies

## Updates

This security policy is subject to change. Please check back regularly for updates.
