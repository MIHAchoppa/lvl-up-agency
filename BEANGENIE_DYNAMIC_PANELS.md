# 🧞‍♂️ BeanGenie™ Dynamic Adaptive Panels

## 🎯 Overview

BeanGenie now features **intelligent, adaptive panels** that automatically create and organize content based on conversation topics. No more fixed categories - panels adapt to your needs in real-time!

---

## ✨ What's New

### Before (Fixed Panels)
```
✗ Only 2 strategy panels (Organic, Bigo Wheel)
✗ Predefined categories
✗ Limited flexibility
✗ Manual categorization
```

### After (Dynamic Panels)
```
✓ Unlimited panel creation
✓ AI-powered categorization  
✓ Adapts to conversation topics

```

---

## 🤖 How It Works

### 1. Intelligent Categorization

When BeanGenie responds, the system:
1. Analyzes the content using AI
2. Identifies relevant categories
3. Creates new panels automatically
4. Extracts metadata (dates, numbers, names)
5. Organizes content intelligently

### 2. Dynamic Panel Creation

**Example Conversation Flow:**

```
User: "What content should I stream this week?"

BeanGenie: "Focus on trending topics like cooking streams, 
Q&A sessions, and collaborative PK battles. Schedule these 
during peak hours 8-10 PM for maximum engagement."

System creates:
📋 Content Ideas Panel
  - Cooking streams
  - Q&A sessions
  - Collaborative PK battles

📅 Scheduling Tips Panel
  - Peak hours: 8-10 PM
  - Frequency: This week
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Processing

**Categorization Flow:**
```
1. User sends message to BeanGenie
2. AI generates response
3. Response sent to /api/beangenie/categorize
4. AI analyzes content with specialized prompt
5. Returns JSON with categories:
   {
     "category_key": "content_ideas",
     "category_name": "Content Ideas",
     "icon": "💡",
     "color": "yellow",
     "extracted_content": "...",
     "metadata": {"target": "this week"}
   }
6. Saved to beangenie_panels collection
7. Frontend displays in dynamic grid
```

### Database Schema

**beangenie_panels Collection:**
```json
{
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "category_key": "content_ideas",
  "category_name": "Content Ideas",
  "icon": "💡",
  "color": "yellow",
  "content": "Focus on cooking streams and Q&A",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-09T...",
  "metadata": {
    "target_date": "this week",
    "priority": "high",
    "tags": ["cooking", "qa"]
  }
}
```

### AI Categorization Prompt

The system uses an intelligent prompt:
```
"Analyze this BIGO Live strategy content and categorize it.
Return JSON with category_key, category_name, icon, color,
extracted_content, and metadata."
```

**Fallback Logic:**
If AI parsing fails, uses keyword matching:
- "organic" → Organic Strategies panel
- "wheel" → Bigo Wheel panel
- "content" → Content Ideas panel
- "schedule" → Scheduling Tips panel
