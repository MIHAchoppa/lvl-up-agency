- ✓ No critical flake8 errors

## Technical Details

### Knowledge Base Schema
```python
{
  "id": "unique-identifier",
  "url": "https://www.bigo.tv/...",
  "title": "Article Title",
  "content": "Full article text (up to 20k chars)",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", ...],
  "created_at": "ISO timestamp",
  "updated_at": "ISO timestamp"
}
```

### Search Implementation
- MongoDB text search with scoring
- Queries search both title and content fields
- Results sorted by relevance score
- Configurable result limits

### Bot Response Flow
1. User sends message
2. Search knowledge base (intelligent query)
3. If no results: Provide helpful fallback with topic detection
4. If results: Build rich context from top 8 sources
5. Enhanced system prompt with BIGO expertise
6. AI generates intelligent, cited response
7. Validate and format sources section
8. Return response with inline citations
