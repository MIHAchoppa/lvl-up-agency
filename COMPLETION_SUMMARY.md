## 📝 Intentional Placeholders Documented

Found **3 intentional placeholders** for future enhancements (NOT bugs):

### 1. Email Sending (Optional)
- **Location:** `backend/server.py:1596`
- **Status:** Works without it - tracks outreach in database
- **Future:** Can integrate SendGrid/SMTP when needed

### 2. Voice Session Tracking (Optional)
- **Location:** `backend/routers/voice_router.py:346`
- **Status:** Returns mock data for development
- **Future:** Can add real session storage when needed

### 3. Social Media Scraping (Optional)
- **Location:** `backend/services/lead_scanner_service.py`
- **Status:** Uses sample data - perfect for demos
- **Future:** Can integrate real APIs when needed

**All 3 are intentional design choices that don't affect core functionality.**
